I enjoyed it, but the wave was frontend; the framework wars were brewing and I was caught up in the hype, such as this:\nNo offense to Kent, but this is certianly one of the videos of all time\nThere was a very chic mystic about frontend engineering and I fell into it, even though I really didn\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nI kept up with it, made my bones and bacon in and with it, lost jobs with it, but I remained in that space, hating every bit of it.\nI began to get angry at the very thought of something breaking because 10 million upstream dependenices depended on this:\nWhich is just checking to see if there is some property on an object. This is basically one line of code that is an upstream dependency on millions of projects. That\u0026rsquo;s just one example.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to rant here, just trying to set context.

They gave me permission, albeit spoken permission which means I will need to get explicit permission in writing before I start, break something important, get sued, and lose friends.\nWhere to start? Easy. SQL injection.\nFirst foray into pen testing a site # My friend hired a lazy developer to create her website. It was hosted on a strange host without SSL enabled which was a huge red flag for me.\nThey were frustrated by his lack of progress developing the site and I was curious about the developer and what stack he used, and, if possible, see if I could break into the site.\njQuery and Angular # The site used a mishmash of jQuery and Angular. My first inclination was to find the authentication page. How? DevTools. Easy enough. Find the route that leads to the auth. The route was /login.js.\nI clicked the file in DevTools which miraculously took me right to the login page, which was also unencrypted.\nI tried what I knew about SQL injection.\nI entered a random character in the username and password fields. What returned was an error but nothing that I could work with; there was no information about the database revealed in the error in the UI.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t give up hope.\nI did some more digging and found the developer of the site on LinkedIn, his information freely available on there. I had his email, now all I would need is a way to guess his password to the site.\nUnfortunately for me, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any password dumps from pastebin or a place like that. All the regular easy passwords didn\u0026rsquo;t work either, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have Kali setup with a tool to compare password hashes and break the encryption to suss out possible passwords.\nStill, it was a fun exercise from someone not knowing what they were doing.\n","date":"29 August 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022-08-29-goin-digging/","section":"Posts","summary":"I have a few pseudo-technical friends with websites, both using a form of WordPress.","title":"Goin Diggin"},{"content":"","date":"29 August 2022","permalink":"/tags/security/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"security"},{"content":"","date":"29 August 2022","permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"web"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of Obsidian and you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of a digital garden then you\u0026rsquo;re already halfway to understanding the premise.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to call these a digital garden; too cutesy for me.
