I\u0026rsquo;ve already built a DDoS Script and an DNS Enumeration tool, but those are no where near the projects I want to build and showcase.\ntwhite96/ddos-script Simple proof of concept script to demonstrate ddos with Python Python 1 0 twhite96/simple-dns-enum-tool A simple dns enumeration tool for pentesting recon Python 0 0 The DDoS script was the most challenging and most rewarding of the two because of how much I struggled to build it, to get my head around Python, a language I hadn\u0026rsquo;t used in 9 years. The DNS enumeration tool was built as part of a YouTube video I watched from a guy that works at TryHackMe now and I put little though into it.\nNow, I feel I am ready to build my own tools. I\u0026rsquo;ve written some thorough notes about the design of this tool, but here are the basics:\nWhat should the script do? What does it accomplish that nmap and rustcan do not? How will you utilize the goals of other, more established scripts to build your own? I\u0026rsquo;ve answered these questions with the following: The script should only do four things # List server shares Find null authentication Enumerate shares List permissions on each shared directory That seems like a fair amount of tasks for the script to accomplish for now.\nBuilding # I\u0026rsquo;ve started building it already.
