The first entry in Gary's OSINT challenge was a photo and the caption, "Hello, Netherlands!"

This was the image:

The next phase of the challenge was for me to look at different landmarks so that I could figure out *where* exactly in the Netherlands the photo was taken.

## Notations

I spotted a few different key items on the image, which you can see in the photo below.

## Solution

I threw the solution up on my *cybersecurity* YouTube channel.
